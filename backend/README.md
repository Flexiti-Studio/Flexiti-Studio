When you make changes to the project:
🔄 Updating Packages to Latest Versions
To keep your project dependencies up to date, follow these steps:

Check outdated packages:


npm outdated
This command lists packages that have newer versions available.

Update the Project Structure section to match your new folder/files.

If you add new routes, document the endpoints under "Example Usage".

If you change the startup command (scripts in package.json), update the Development section.
